## How to get there?

The real question is:

* But where??
* We will get there, if the time is right

```python
import life

necessary = infty

# This is bad and need a fix (lgtm tho)
while life.energy < necessary:
	try:
		stay = hard
	finally:
		die # NOTE: you should not!


exit()

```

This is all nice, but will it work?

## How do we end?

The real stuff:
