## This is my take on the subject

I want to be clear, it is a really, really interesting one!

> *The more interesting stuff one reads, the more muscle he gains!* - literally no one said never

## How to get there?

The real question is:

* But where??
* We will get there, if the time is right

```python
import life

necessary = infty

# This is bad and need a fix (lgtm tho)
while life.energy < necessary:
	try:
		stay = hard
	finally:
		die # NOTE: you should not!

exit()
```

This is all nice, but will it work?

## How do we end?

The real stuff:

This was nice. Lil' bit of this, lil' bit of that - I should finish my slides, otherwise I'm dead.
